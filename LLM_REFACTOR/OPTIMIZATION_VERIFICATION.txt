YAEP EXPANSION PLAN - OPTIMIZATION COVERAGE VERIFICATION
========================================================

Question: Does the plan cover at least these optimizations?

1. Leo's Optimization              ✅ YES - Main Benefit: Faster right-recursive parse
   → Covered in: Section 2.2.1, Phase 7 (Weeks 9-10)

2. Packed Parse Forests            ✅ YES - Main Benefit: Efficient ambiguity handling  
   → Covered in: Section 2.2.3, Phase 8, Week 11

3. Nullable Preprocessing          ✅ YES - Main Benefit: Reduces redundant predictions
   → Covered in: Section 2.2.2, Phase 6 (Weeks 7-8)

4. Fast State Deduplication        ✅ YES - Main Benefit: Lowers memory/time use
   → Covered in: Section 2.2.4, Phase 6, Week 8

5. Pruning/Early Stopping          ✅ YES - Main Benefit: Avoids wasted computation
   → Covered in: Section 2.2.5, Phase 8, Week 12

6. Aycock–Horspool Optimization    ✅ YES - Main Benefit: Faster scan step by grouping scanner items
   → Covered in: Section 2.2.6, Phase 8, Week 12

========================================================
RESULT: ✅✅✅ ALL 6 OPTIMIZATIONS ARE COVERED ✅✅✅
========================================================

Summary:
- 6 out of 6 requested optimizations included in plan
- Each has dedicated implementation section with:
