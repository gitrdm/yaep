# Warning Baseline (Phase P0)

Generated: $(date)
Branch: yaep-expansion
Script: ./build_and_test.sh (clean build)

Total warnings detected: 1787

## Category Buckets (initial rough grep)

| Category (Pattern) | Count (rough) |
|--------------------|---------------|
| -Wconversion | $(grep -c "conversion" build_warnings.log) |
| -Wsign-conversion | $(grep -c "sign-conversion" build_warnings.log) |
| -Wshadow | $(grep -c "shadow" build_warnings.log) |
| -Wmissing-prototypes | $(grep -c "missing-prototypes" build_warnings.log) |
| -Wmissing-declarations | $(grep -c "missing-declarations" build_warnings.log) |
| -Wunused-parameter | $(grep -c "unused parameter" build_warnings.log) |
| -Wunused-variable | $(grep -c "unused variable" build_warnings.log) |
| -Wunused-function | $(grep -c "defined but not used" build_warnings.log) |
| -Wmaybe-uninitialized | 0 (was $(grep -c "may be used uninitialized" build_warnings.log) in original baseline log) |
| -Wimplicit-function-declaration | $(grep -c "implicit declaration" build_warnings.log) |
| -Wold-style-cast | $(grep -c "old-style cast" build_warnings.log) |
| -Wstrict-prototypes | $(grep -c "strict-prototypes" build_warnings.log) |
| overlength-strings | $(grep -c "overlength-strings" build_warnings.log) |

(Note: counts include generated code; final scope will exclude accepted generated patterns.)

## Representative Samples (First 50)

```
$(head -50 build_warnings.log)
```

## Next Actions (For Phase P1 Intake)
- [ ] Filter out generated (flex/bison) acceptable warnings
- [ ] Produce definitive list of unique warning signatures
- [ ] Map each signature to owning file & planned fix ID (P1A-*, P1B-*, etc.)
- [ ] Update IMPLEMENTATION_EXECUTION_PLAN.md P1 tables with counts per row

## P1 Delta Log

| Batch | Category | Before | After | Delta | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| P1 Batch1 | maybe-uninitialized | 4 (est) | 0 | -4 | Initialized start/min_cost/result/term_node_array; guarded free; fresh build shows none |
