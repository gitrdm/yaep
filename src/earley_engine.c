/**
 * @file earley_engine.c
 * @brief Earley parsing engine implementation
 *
 * MODULE PURPOSE:
 *   This module implements the core Earley parsing algorithm, extracted
 *   from the monolithic yaep.c for better modularity. The Earley engine
 *   is responsible for building the parse list (sequence of Earley sets)
 *   by executing prediction, scanning, and completion steps.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (Phase P2):
 *   During the initial modularization phase, functions will be gradually
 *   extracted from yaep.c. This file starts as a skeleton with stub
 *   functions that will be filled in incrementally, maintaining behavior
 *   parity at each step.
 *
 * DESIGN INVARIANTS:
 *   - Engine does not own the grammar (pointer only)
 *   - All parse-specific memory allocated via grammar's allocator
 *   - Engine can be reused for multiple parses via reset()
 *   - Thread-safety: One engine per thread (not thread-safe internally)
 *
 * FUTURE OPTIMIZATIONS (Phases P3-P7):
 *   - P3: Add nullable preprocessing, state deduplication, memory pools
 *   - P4: Add Leo items for right-recursion optimization
 *   - P5: Add SPPF (Shared Packed Parse Forest) for ambiguous parses
 *   - P6: Add pruning and Aycock-Horspool scanner optimization
 *
 * REFERENCES:
 *   - Earley (1970) "An efficient context-free parsing algorithm"
 *   - Aycock & Horspool (2002) "Practical Earley Parsing"
 *   - Leo (1991) "A general context-free parsing algorithm..."
 *
 * PHASE: P2 - Modularization (Behavior-Preserving Refactoring)

 *   The full algorithm will:
 *   1. Initialize parse list with start set
 *   2. For each token in input:
 *      a. Look up transition from current set
 *      b. Build new set if transition exists (scanning)
 *      c. Perform prediction and completion (closure)
 *      d. Advance to next set
 *   3. Handle error recovery if no transition found
 *   4. Return success/failure
 *
 * ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY: O(nÂ³) for arbitrary CFGs
 *   where n = input length
 *
 * @param engine Earley engine instance (must not be NULL)
 *
 * @return 0 on success, non-zero error code on failure
 *         Currently always returns -1 (not implemented)
 *
 * TESTING: Once implemented, must produce identical results to original
 *

 *   This function will be gradually implemented in subsequent commits
 *   of Phase P2 (tasks P2-001-C, P2-001-D, P2-001-E).
